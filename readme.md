## EEsaver: The Basic Idea

EEsaver is a starting point for building ExpressionEngine-powered Treesaver sites. [We love EE](http://monkeydo.biz/), and we think that its highly-customizable nature (not to mention its low price) makes it an ideal system for delivering the long-form, magazine-style content Treesaver was designed to publish.

What we've put together is a free set of ExpressionEngine templates, plus instructions for configuring EE to make them work. Drop in some content and you've got the beginnings of your own cross-platform magazine.
